                    <h1>Social Media & Personal Branding</h1>
                    <p>Personal branding entails of an individual’s strengths, visibility, engagement, values, mission and vision. It allows one to distinguish oneself from everyone else, in addition to promoting one’s strengths. By developing a strong personal brand, this identity can aid in the process of achieving both career and private goals. A personal brand statement should incorporate unique selling points, target audiences, and a value. My statement is that I aim to assist developers and designers in achieving their goals to present the full potential of their products to the public as a Project Manager of a large technological company.</p>
                    <p>I would describe my personal brand characteristics as a hardworking individual who strives to obtain outstanding results and excels at working independently with minimal supervision. I can incorporate these skills into the workplace by being able to take on projects by myself and organizing all the necessary assignments to adhere to deadlines. I am very good at time management and setting deadlines to ensure that tasks are done in advance to allow for feedback and edits.</p>
                    <p>My values involve finding a job position that I am passionate about and care about the responsibilities I have. I wish to find a career in project management in the business-IT industry where I will be interested in the work I am doing because that will strengthen my commitment and ensure that I put in my best efforts. I value teamwork so I desire a job with peers that feels like a community in that we respect one another and collaborate well together with integrity and accountability.</p>
                    <p>The article, "From Cattle to Coke to Charlie" states that self-marketing entails activities that one undertakes to make themselves known in the marketplace. In order to promote my own brand, I can use social media as I lack the funds to hire professional help. With the ePortfolio assignment, I have created my own personal website that allows me to display who I am and what my skills and experiences are. Through different subheadings, I am able to showcase examples of my academic work, design portfolio, and work experience. Future employers will be able to view all my accomplishments in one central location that I have designed. I believe that my website portrays my personal brand because I provide examples of my academic projects which show that I am capable of working independently and with group members. I also give examples of my design and coding work which shows that I have proficient technological level. This correlates with my goal to work as a project manager in the business-IT industry because I am experienced in both fields and am eager to learn in aspects that I lack knowledge in. </p>
                    <p>Additionally, I have linked my social media sites where they can further explore my skill sets. I chose to utilized LinkedIn to portray my work experiences and Github to demonstrate my external coding projects. Although the BDC Social Media eBook suggests using Facebook and Twitter to increase visibility, I chose not to. For myself personally, I do not use Twitter because I do not find that I have any interesting short tidbits to offer and my Facebook is exclusively for friends that I know in real life. I selected two mediums to share because they help to promote my professional image which is the message I want to send to prospective employers. I find that Facebook and Twitter are more for socializing on a more personal level and I prefer to separate that aspect of my life from my professional self.  My future goals to further enhance my social media presence is to work on my Google+ profile as it will allow me to portray my professional interests and scan posts for relevant topics of interest.</p>

                </div>
                <div id="presentation" class="box-expanded btn-blue">
                    <h1>Presentation Skills</h1>
                    <p>One area that I wish to improve upon is my presentation skills because although I am good at interacting with others in small groups, I get nervous in larger settings. In order to accomplish my goal, I will take on more leadership roles and practice my public speaking skills with smaller groups and work my way up to larger audiences. I have found that one of the best ways of addressing this issue is to be prepared with all necessary information and to rehearse prior. While this does not guarantee that I will be great at on-the-spot presentations, it will allow me to build up the confidence to work towards that obstacle in the future.</p>
                    <p>The CSLP Soft Skills Development guide states that it is important to determine what the objectives of the presentation to know what the audience should take away from it. One of the most important aspects of any presentation is to establish who the target audience is. No matter how informative or well-prepared one can be, if a presentation is addressed to the wrong people, it is pointless and irrelevant. I will have to assess who I am speaking to and the general characteristics the group possesses in order to design my presentation according to their preferences. For example, if it is to a group of scientists, I would include statistical data from accredited sources or if it is to a group of business executives, I would include financial figures and projected values.</p>
                    <p>My evaluation from my Ted Talks video showed me that I have to work on the persuasiveness of my content to make my discussion more significant to the target audience. To do so, I will be sure to address why my presentation will benefit the audience and what they can learn from it at the beginning in order to capture their attention. To further improve upon this, I can connect my topic to everyday life to demonstrate how it can be utilized by the average individual. I had a group presentation for my Econ 344 Marketing course this term which taught me to leave room for questions at the end of my presentation when I am given a time allotment.</p>
                    <p>Once I have created a presentation outline that follows my objectives and is catered towards my target audience, I can begin working towards the actual content. This includes displays that will help to reinforce my points in a illustrative way. I will keep my artifacts simple by only highlighting the most important material to limit the amount information as much as possible (Amstat, 2014). The usage of images, videos, and graphs can help sum up relevant material and help audience members visualize the statements made. It is important to realize that artifacts are meant to enhance a presentation, not become the main focus which is the actual speech.</p>
                    <p>When I am presenting my content, I will have to practice beforehand to make sure that I stay within a suitable time of my limit with a sufficient room for questions. My current preparation method is to rehearse to myself in a private setting several times with cue cards that have a few words to summarize my main points. As I created my own presentation, I am familiar and knowledgeable about my topic. Once I have rehearsed it a few times alone, I become able to dictate my entire presentation by memory, however, I acknowledge that nerves will come into play once there is an audience. The cue cards are meant to serve as a reminder in case I forget momentarily and only state keywords so I can associate it to my content.</p>
                    <p>The last step that I take to prepare is to work on my physical presentation skills. CSLP outlines that the voice, body gestures, and eye contact are essential elements to any performance. I will have to work towards harnessing my voice to utilize pauses to help emphasis my points and prevent myself from speaking too fast. I am fairly good with hand gestures, but I have room for improvement on using my presentation space sufficiently. I should not stay rooted to one position, but utilize the space I am given to help stress my points.</p>

                    <h1>Etiquette and Interpersonal Skills</h1>
                    <p>The behavior in which a person demonstrates in their workplace portrays the type of person they are to their peers and co-workers. No matter what job position, there must be a line drawn between one's professional and personal life. When interacting with peers who are linked to work, whether it be a co-worker or client/customer, a professional etiquette must be utilized. The article, "Proper Business Etiquette," highlights the following tips: make a positive impression, cooperate with colleagues, communicate with care, master meetings, and be work space savvy. I already demonstrate most of these points as I have completed 2 co-op terms.</p>
                    <p>First impressions are extremely important as you only get one chance to make it. When I have my co-op interviews, I ensure that I am 15 minutes early and begin with a firm handshake with a friendly greeting. I want to present myself as a professional student who has skills to provide and the eagerness to learn. I make sure to maintain eye contact, be alert, listen attentively, and be courteous. Once I have been matched with a job, I send an acceptance email that illustrates my ability to communicate with care by ensuring that it is professional, relevant, and provides all necessary information. My first day on the job, I make sure to introduce myself to colleagues and begin developing positive, friendly relationships with them while being mindful of how open I am with my personal life. I make sure I remember their names by associating them to an attribute that I can connect to them because people enjoy hearing their own names. While in my work environment, I will follow all written code and unwritten rules by being aware of my surroundings. I will conduct myself in a professional manner through all mediums: in person, computer, telephone, and email.</p>
                    <p>I possess interpersonal skills as I enjoy interacting with others and making an effort to listen to their ideas. This will contribute to my ambitions as project managers are in constant communication with vendors, clients, and internal departments. Team work is extremely important in these positions which means that I will have to create positive relationships. I am fairly attentive and mindful of other people's expressions and emotions. By simply talking to others about how they are feeling, I can gain insight into their wants and needs which can allow me to determine how to help them and anticipate what they need. I will ensure to not abuse these relationships by still working independently and exhausting all my efforts before reaching out to show that I made an attempt.</p>
                    <p>One of my long-term goals is to work in a foreign country to gain experience in other markets. This requires that I am aware of some of the etiquette for the specific country I am working in. While it may be difficult to learn a new language, I can research common phrases to show that I made a conscious effort to communicate without implying that I am fluent. I am learn about local customs such as how the "OK" hand signal should be avoided in Japan because it means money or that it is acceptable to be 15-30 minutes late for meetings in Russia (Cyborklink, 2012). When working in a foreign country, I must ensure that I am presenting myself in a reputable manner by respecting their traditions despite differences from North American customs.</p>

                    <h1>Goal Setting and Time Management</h1>
                    <p>Goals allow a person to set achievements that they want to accomplish by a certain time frame. The best way to develop these goals is to follow the SMART model to ensure that it is specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely (Top Achievement, 2011).  By following these guidelines, the goal will be set within reasonable terms that makes them achievable by the individual. This requires knowing one's own capabilities to ensure that the goal is well-suited and personalized. Randy Pausch's "Time Management" presentation describes how one can clarify goals and achieve them by asking a few key questions first. This includes, "Why am I doing this?," "What is the goal?," "Why will I succeed?," and "What happens if I choose not to do it?".</p>
                    <p>My goals entail of both short-term and long-term accomplishments I hope to achieve in order to be successful in my work career. My short term goals are to continue to take advantage of my academic and coop terms to increase my knowledge and familiarity in the business and technology industries. This will give me insight into how business models are executed and how to handle various technological products. My long term goals is to work at a large company that can give me the ability to work with individuals who may not be able to put their innovations into action and  to gain experience working in foreign countries in order to learn their customs which give me a competitive edge in my work field. When I graduate, I will take the Certified Associate in Project Management test in order to receive my certification to gain more accreditation along with my experiences (PMI, 2015). According to Randy Pausch's questions, the reason I am setting these goals is to ensure success in my professional work career by finding a position I enjoy in my field of interest. If I do not set these goals, I may find myself settling for a job that I am not passionate about which is why it is important that I set these goals.</p>
                    <p>In order to achieve my set goals, I will have to manage my time appropriately. My short term goals are set to be achieved before I graduate, with a deadline of April 2017 while my long term goal will be given a 5-year process plan after I graduate. Setting the goal is the first step towards success, but one must plan accordingly in order to ensure that the end goal is broken down into simple steps to be more attainable. Randy Pausch states that one of the best ways to manage time efficiently is to create To-do lists, specifically Covey's four-quadrant. This divides up tasks into their level of importance and their due date to ensure that all responsibilities are taken care of. While my long-term goal may seem far into the future, I acknowledge that there are steps that I can take currently that will help guide me towards achieving it.</p>
                    <p>My current action plan is to do well on my courses and secure coop project management positions, preferably at technological companies. As my final goal is to be a Project Manager, I know that I cannot do so without obtaining my PMI certification first. In the meantime, I have obtained 2 Project Coordinator positions which is similar, but with less responsibilities. I will utilize one of my coop terms to apply to an international firm in order to better acquainted with foreign markets and business practices which can only aid in managing products that need a global presence. These stepping stones will give me both academic knowledge and relevant hands-on experience when I am applying for full-time positions at more well-known companies as a Project Manager, which is my ultimate business aspiration. My to-do list will be created every term to ensure that I do well in the classroom and secure good co-op placements on my online time-management journal in order to reduce paperwork. This will allow me to edit easily, retrieve any discarded information, sort by priority, set alerts for deadlines and check off tasks that I have accomplished. I have set these goals which means that I have to schedule myself to avoid procrastination, accomplish to-do list tasks, and constantly review my progress to adjust my goals accordingly.</p>
